Hi, my name is Abigail. 
2 years ago, I begun to participate in hackathons
I think you can get a lot experience. In my first
Hackathon my team and I won the first place and as a
prize we went to other hackaton at the stanford 
University and we won a third place in a challenge
of IBM.

I am part of the algorithms Club at my school, we learn
about algorithm to competitive programming because
we participate in the ICPC contest, the last year
was my first time in that contest with a team of just girls and we got the one hundred and nineteen place of more of 3 houndred teams. 
I think I am just a beginner but i would like to clasificate to the Regional Contest.

In the hackathon of the Stanford University, mi team and I developed and  application to help kids with autims
where the principal idea was to help them to improve 
their skills, the application allow you to create
your imaginary friends and play with them.
My rol was to develop the web application and the challange there was to learn a tecnology by IBM to connect a web application
an mobile application in just 2 days.
--- And we won the third place.

In my cryptography class, mi final project I had to develop an application to a company and I my team wanted to program in python and Flask, I didnt know about them but I learned about this tools and my rol was to create a platform to create a document and the user can make his digital signature, it with an RSA algorithm.
